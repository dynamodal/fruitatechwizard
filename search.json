    "text": "Hi, I’m Thomas!\nI’m an independent consultant based in Fruita. My main work at Dynamodal involves supporting utilities and energy companies with efficiency and data analysis projects. I enjoy that work, and I also wanted to do something to support my local community, so I started Fruita Tech Wizard to provide friendly, personalized tech support for local residents and small businesses.\nI’ve always been the go-to tech person for my family, friends, and coworkers, and I enjoy helping people solve tech problems. Whether it’s fixing a slow computer, resolving errors after a Windows upgrade, setting up a new phone, or optimizing a WiFi network, I’m here to help.\nI studied Physics and Electrical Engineering at the Colorado School of Mines. After a few years in the Alaskan oil fields, I moved back to Colorado and began working as a data science consultant.\nWhen I’m not working, I enjoy biking, running, and exploring the trails and rivers around Fruita.\n\nWhy FTW?\nI picked “FTW” as a fun nod to Fruita’s WTF (Welcome to Fruita) stickers. It also stands for “For The Win,” which is what I aim to help you do with your technology."
