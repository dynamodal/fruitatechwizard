    "text": "Hi, I’m Thomas!\nI’m an independent consultant based in Fruita. My main gig (Dynamodal) is working with utilities and energy companies across the nation on energy effficiency and data analysis projects. I enjoy that work, but I also want do something to help my local community, so I started Fruita Tech Wizard to provide friendly, personalized tech support for local residents and businesses.\nI’ve always been the go-to tech person for my family, friends and coworkers, and I love helping people solve their tech problems. Whether it’s fixing a slow computer, sorting out errors after the latest Windows upgarde, setting up a new phone, or optimizing a WiFi network, I’m here to help.\nI studied Physics and Electrical Engineering at the Colorado School of Mines. After a few years in the Alaskan oil fields, I moved back to Colorado and started working as a data science consultant.\nWhen I’m not working, I enjoy biking, running, and exploring the trails and rivers around Fruita.\n\nWhy FTW ?\nI think it’s a fun nod to Fruita’s “memorable” (infamous?) WTF (Welcome to Fruita) stickers. And of course, FTW is internet slang for “For The Win”, which is exactly what I want to help you do with your technology!"
