Hi, I'm Thomas! 

I'm an independent consultant based in Fruita. My [main gig](https://dynamodal.com/) is working with utilities and energy companies across the nation on energy effficiency and data analysis projects. I enjoy that work, but I also want do something to help my *local* community, so I started Fruita Tech Wizard to provide friendly, personalized tech support for local residents and businesses.

I've always been the go-to tech person for my family, friends and coworkers, and I love helping people solve their tech problems. Whether it's fixing a slow computer, sorting out errors after the latest Windows upgarde, setting up a new phone, or optimizing a WiFi network, I'm here to help.

I studied Physics and Electrical Engineering at the Colorado School of Mines. After a few years in the Alaskan oil fields, I moved back to Colorado and started working as a data science consultant. 

When I'm not working, I enjoy biking, running, and exploring the trails and rivers around Fruita. 

### Why FTW ?

I think it's a fun nod to Fruita's "memorable" [WTF (Welcome to Fruita)](https://fruita.com/wtf-welcome-to-fruita/) stickers. And of course, `FTW` is internet slang for "For The Win", which is exactly what I want to help you do with your technology!
