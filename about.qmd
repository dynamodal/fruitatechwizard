Hi, I'm Thomas! 

I'm an independent consultant based in Fruita.
My main work at [Dynamodal](https://dynamodal.com/) involves supporting utilities and energy companies with efficiency and data analysis projects.
I enjoy that work, and I also wanted to do something to support my local community, so I started Fruita Tech Wizard to provide friendly, personalized tech support for local residents and small businesses.


I've always been the go-to tech person for my family, friends, and coworkers, and I enjoy helping people solve tech problems.
Whether it's fixing a slow computer, resolving errors after a Windows upgrade, setting up a new phone, or optimizing a WiFi network, I'm here to help.


I [studied](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomascwells/) Physics and Electrical Engineering at the Colorado School of Mines.
After a few years in the Alaskan oil fields, I moved back to Colorado and began working as a data science consultant. 


When I'm not working, I enjoy biking, running, and exploring the trails and rivers around Fruita.

### Why FTW?

I picked "FTW" as a fun nod to Fruita's [WTF (Welcome to Fruita)](https://fruita.com/wtf-welcome-to-fruita/) stickers.
It also stands for "For The Win," which is what I aim to help you do with your technology.
